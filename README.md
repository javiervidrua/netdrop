**Like AirDrop, but this runs on Python**.

After using the disgustingly slow file sharing over bluetooth "app" that *Windows 10* has, a friend of mine (@MikenTNT) came up with this idea of **making something better in Python**.

Using **websockets**, it is able to share files at _**7MB/s**_ (1000 times faster than the *Windows 10* "app").
